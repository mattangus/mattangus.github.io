My main research interest is in computer vision, specifically semantic segmentation for scene understanding and end to end learning for steering angle regression.

## Semantic Segmentation
-----

Semantic segmentation is the task of taking an image and assigning each pixel a class. An example is shown below.

State of the art algorithms rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
