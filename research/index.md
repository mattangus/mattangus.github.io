My main research interest is in computer vision, specifically semantic segmentation for scene understanding and end to end learning for steering angle regression.

## Semantic Segmentation
-----

Semantic segmentation is the task of taking an image and assigning a class to each pixel. An example is shown below.

**Original Image**
![Original Image][original]{:class="center-block"}

**Semantically Segmented Image**
![Segmented Image][segmented]{:class="center-block"}

State of the art algorithms rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
