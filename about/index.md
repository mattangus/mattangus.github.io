## About Me

I am a machine learning engineer with experience in object detection, semantic segmentation and lane detection all focusing on mobility. I have a Masters of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Calgary.

My interest in autonomous driving started with the [Autonomous Robotics Club](https://www.facebook.com/uofcrobotics/) (ARC) at the University of Calgary. The purpose of the club was to create an autonomous robot that was capable of navigating an obstacle course at the [Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition](http://www.igvc.org/). We achieved our goal and became the [rookies of the year](http://www.igvc.org/results/r2016.pdf). Leading to great opportunities to work on the Autonomoose project at the University of Waterloo, which was the first autonomous vehicle to be approved for public road tests in Canada. Lately I have been working at Humanising Autonomy building light weight multi task networks for low power inference.
