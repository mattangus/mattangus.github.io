## About Me

**Matt Angus** is a masters student studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. He completed his Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Calgary.

My interest in autonomous driving started with the [Autonomous Robotics Club](https://www.facebook.com/uofcrobotics/) (ARC) at the University of Calgary. The purpose of the club was to create an autonomous robot that was capable of navigating an obsticle course at the [Inteligent Ground Vehicle Competition](http://www.igvc.org/). This goal was achieved, and we became the [rookies of the year](http://www.igvc.org/results/r2016.pdf).
