# Matthew Angus
I am an enthusiastic and hardworking person who has been responsible for developing innovative technologies in both my academic and professional work. I am interested in developing new, exciting, or even radical ideas that have the potential to shape the future of how people interact with technology.

## Education
---
<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">Sept ’16 - Present</span> **Master of Mathematics in Computer Science**, *The University of Waterloo*. -- 3.98/4 Major GPA

- Semantic segmentation and pixel-level out-of-distribution detection.

- Wrote custom TensorFlow unpool operation with CUDA GPU implementation, with $2\times$ speed up at inference time.

- Created largest public synthetic segmentation dataset to date using GTAV (1 million+ images).

- Multiple courses and course projects in machine learning.

<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">Sept ’11 - April ’16</span> **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**, *The University of Calgary*, Minor in Pure Mathematics, Concentration in Algorithms and Complexity Theory. -- 3.68/4 Major GPA

- Sought out Dr. Rob Kremer to collaboratively research ontology inference for a semantic knowledgebase where I decreased the runtime of our inference algorithm by 97% to achieve a runtime in $$O(x^n)$$.

- Two semester exchange at the University of Western Australia where I was able to grow personally, academically and culturally by studying and traveling in Australia and surrounding countries.

## Work Experience
---

<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">May '18 -  Present</span> **Research Engineer**, *NXP Semiconductors*, Ottawa

- Extended state of the art world models for autonomous driving.

- Implemented and trained deep learning models, such as variational auto-encoders and RNNs, in TensorFlow using the Carla driving simulator.

- Researched independently, providing key milestones to co-workers.

<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">Jan ’15 - Aug ’16</span> **Application Developer**, *Canadian Natural Resources Limited*, Calgary.

- Consulted on architecting the data and business layers of a responsibility management system that tracked responsibilities globally, that extracted a hierarchy from a relational database.

- Helped translate internal customer requirements into action items for our development team.

- Championed and implemented bug tracking best practices across our development team, previously there was none.

<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">May ’12 - Dec ’13</span> **Security Analyst**, *Canadian Natural Resources Limited*, Calgary.

- Took initiative and automated various manual processes through the use of scripts, saving the team about 3 hours per week.

- Performed within the company's workflow to deliver access to various applications.
