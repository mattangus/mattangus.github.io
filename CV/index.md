<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">Feb '24 - Present</span> **Principal Computer Vision Engineer**, *Humanising Autonomy*, London UK

- Regularly guided the business with technology decisions, such as client-facing feature deprecation strategy
- Productionised multi-task learning training, testings, model conversion, and model release
- Created forward collision warning evaluation, and metrics tracking
- Transitioned from GOCD to GitHub actions and Championed adoption of Conan
- "Innovation day" projects widely used. For example, automated SDK python bindings and camera calibration web-app

<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">Oct '22 - Feb '24</span> **Senior Computer Vision Engineer**, *Humanising Autonomy*, London UK

- Architected MLOps workflow from the ground up, automating reporting and
- Built a multi-task learning framework, and trained Object detection, lane detection, and camera obstruction tasks jointly
- Contributed to production C++ codebase, such as implementing an omnidirectional camera model
- Led team of one mid and two junior level engineers to overhaul the company's MLOps
- Automated the creation of a synthetic collision dataset with 300 videos from 20 scenarios dataset using CARLA simulator

<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">Jan '20 - Feb '22</span> **Computer Vision Engineer**, *Humanising Autonomy*, London UK

- Training YOLO object detection models with Darknet, writing custom augmentation and LR schedules in C++
- Leveraged open source scene reconstruction libraries combined with semantic segmentation to generate and label maps

<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">May '18 -  Aug '18</span> **Research Engineer**, *NXP Semiconductors*, Ottawa Canada

- Extended state of the art world models for autonomous driving.

- Implemented and trained deep learning models, such as variational auto-encoders and RNNs, in TensorFlow using the Carla driving simulator.

- Researched independently, providing key milestones to co-workers.

<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">Jan ’15 - Aug ’16</span> **Application Developer**, *Canadian Natural Resources Limited*, Calgary Canada

- Consulted on architecting the data and business layers of a responsibility management system that tracked responsibilities globally, that extracted a hierarchy from a relational database.

- Helped translate internal customer requirements into action items for our development team.

- Championed and implemented bug tracking best practices across our development team, previously there was none.

<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">May ’12 - Dec ’13</span> **Security Analyst**, *Canadian Natural Resources Limited*, Calgary Canada

- Took initiative and automated various manual processes through the use of scripts, saving the team about 3 hours per week.

- Performed within the company's workflow to deliver access to various applications.

## Education
---
<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">Sept '16 - July '19</span> **Master of Mathematics in Computer Science**, *The University of Waterloo*. -- 3.98/4 Major GPA

- Semantic segmentation and pixel-level out-of-distribution detection.

- Wrote custom TensorFlow unpool operation with CUDA GPU implementation, with $$2\times$$ speed up at inference time.

- Created largest public synthetic segmentation dataset to date using GTAV (1 million+ images).

- Multiple courses and course projects in machine learning.

<span style="color:{{ page.base-colour }}">Sept ’11 - April ’16</span> **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**, *The University of Calgary*, Minor in Pure Mathematics, Concentration in Algorithms and Complexity Theory. -- 3.68/4 Major GPA

- Sought out Dr. Rob Kremer to collaboratively research ontology inference for a semantic knowledgebase where I decreased the runtime of our inference algorithm by 97% to achieve a runtime in $$O(x^n)$$.

- Two semester exchange at the University of Western Australia where I was able to grow personally, academically and culturally by studying and traveling in Australia and surrounding countries.
